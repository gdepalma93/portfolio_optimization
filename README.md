# Trading Algo Ranking System

![Portfolio Analysis](Images/portfolio-analysis.png)

## Background

This project started as a pandas homework assignment for NU Fintech Bootcamp. This tool determines which portfolio is performing the best across the following areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

An anlaysis notebook that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of portfolios, and ranks the performance of the portfolios. The current data was given by Northwestern Fintech staff. We were given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds.

This tool accomplishes the following.

1. [Read in and Wrangle Returns Data](#Prepare-the-Data)
2. [Determine Success of Each Portfolio](#Conduct-Quantitative-Analysis)


## Future additions
I aim to build a plethora of trading algorithms over my lifetime. I plan to use this tool to allocate capital to my algos based on various performance metrics. I will add performance metrics to the analysis as well, such as sortino ratio.
